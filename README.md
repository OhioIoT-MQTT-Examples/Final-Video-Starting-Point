## Getting Started

`git clone https://github.com/OhioIoT-MQTT-Examples/Final-Video-Starting-Point`


### PlatformIO
- Change ***lib/credentials/credentials_template*** to ***lib/credentials/credentials.h***, and edit the credentials
- Compile and upload your code


### Arduino IDE
#### Option 1 ####
- Copy all folders in ***lib/*** to your Arduino ***libraries/*** folder
- Copy ***credentials/credentials_template*** to ***credentials/credentials.h***, and edit the credentials
- Create a project folder, and copy ***src/main.cpp*** into that folder with a name that matches, ending in *.ino
- Download PubSubClient.h using the Arduino IDE Library Manager
#### Option 2 ####
- Copy all of the files from the subfolders inside ***lib/*** into the same project folder created above, and keep all of the files, including the *.ino, together
